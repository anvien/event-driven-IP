# event-driven-IP
Event-driven intrinsic plasticity (IP) learning rules for spiking neural networks.

# Paper
Simulation code for paper titled "Event-Driven Intrinsic Plasticity for Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks".
This paper is still under review.

# Usage
The code is in Matlab runtime, please install Matlab 2017+ before use.
* Run "example_convnet.mlx" to start the experiment.

** Note: if you want to run the Fashion-MNIST dataset, please unzip "..\dlt_cnn_map_dropout_nobiasnn\data\fashion_mnist\train-images-idx3-ubyte.zip" first.
